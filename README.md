    An imitation of the inventory from the official game called DayZ but in SvelteKit.

## 🔖 Description
This project consists of replicating the inventory of the official game called _[DayZ](https://dayz.com)_ with the aim of developing my skills and knowledge with _[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)_. Initially, I developed the project with the idea of creating a game mode completely similar to the _DayZ_ game on _[FiveM](https://fivem.net)_, but over the development stage I ran out of free time and motivation to continue with this project.

> [!WARNING]  
> The inventory doesn't have all the features, nor is it ready to be used in FiveM _(this is intentional, I actually have an improved version with FiveM integration)_. This is just an example of how you can develop something like this and adapt it to your liking or even to _FiveM_.

### ⌨️ Keys
The keys are very simple, here is a list of the keys that is being listened:
* **Mouse - Left Click**: To drag the item
* **Space**: To rotate the item

### ⚙️ Development
In terms of development, this is highly recommended for developers and not _Configurators_, because the project is not prepared nor is it modular to adapt any game/website, it requires changes to adapt them. Regarding the structure of the project, I think it's well-organized and there's not much to explain, check it out for yourselves and if you find any errors report them in the Issues or any improvements you think could be made make a PR.

> [!TIP]
> I foresee a lot of people will be from the FIveM community, so here's a tip, in order for this project to work on FiveM, you'll need to convert from SvelteKit to Svelte and implement events/handlers to update the inventory states according to the state on the _server_/_client_ side.
